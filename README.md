## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

I've included 4 screenshots in the `/screenshots` folder: mobile, tablet, desktop, and fullscreen.

## My process

I started with the HTML alone then did the CSS for the mobile version. This process is easier, that way I'm not 
overwriting too many things in media queries. 

Had a little trouble with margins and padding on this one, especially centering the card itself, but I figured
it out eventually.

The image used in the design had a purple filter applied, but the one in `/images` folder was black and white.
I've explored multiple ways to change it to that color e.g. external photo editing software and the 
`filter` property, but I can't figure out how to do it.

I'll update this README when I'm able to make that change. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how you can change the filter on images using the `filter` property. I also read up quite a bit
on background images and flexbox. 

I used `flex-flow: row-reverse;` to change the order of the items - something I haven't used much until now - so I guess I can include that in things I learned.

### Continued development

I still need to work on time management. I completed this one a little bit faster, but I can do better. Again,
more practice should help with this. 

I also need to practice working with images more. I'm not struggling with it, but it's not second nature just yet.
Same goes for flexbox. 

One step at a time.
